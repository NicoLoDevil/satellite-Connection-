## 📞 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "ZoomLevel displays but nothing happens"
→ Make sure you're using 2 fingers on mobile, not 1

### "Direction guidance doesn't appear"
→ Wait 2 seconds after clicking emergency, ensure satellite is visible

### "Device warning covers screen"
→ Fix the issue (charge battery, close apps) or refresh page

### "Slow/jumpy animation"
→ Close other browser tabs, reduces graphics quality slightly

### "Can't find satellites"
→ Make sure GPS is on, and you granted location permission
